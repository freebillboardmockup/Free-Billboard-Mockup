## Billboard Design Tips
Creating an effective billboard design requires more than just a good mockup. Here are some expert tips to guide you:

### 1. Keep It Simple
Billboards are viewed for just a few seconds. Use bold fonts, minimal text, and striking visuals to convey your message quickly.

### 2. Prioritize Contrast
High contrast between text and background ensures readability from a distance. Test your design with a mockup to see how it holds up.

### 3. Use High-Resolution Images
Low-quality visuals look blurry when scaled up. Always start with high-res assets, and refine them using tools like Photoshop or mockups from Free Billboard Mockup.

### 4. Consider Location
Think about where your billboard will be placed—urban settings, highways, or rural areas—and adjust your design accordingly.

### 5. Test with Mockups
Before finalizing your design, apply it to a mockup. This helps you visualize the end result and make adjustments as needed.
